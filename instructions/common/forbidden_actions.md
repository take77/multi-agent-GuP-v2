# Forbidden Actions

## Common Forbidden Actions (All Agents)

| ID | Action | Instead | Reason |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| F004 | Polling/wait loops | Event-driven (inbox) | Wastes API credits |
| F005 | Skip context reading | Always read first | Prevents errors |
| F006 | mainブランチでファイルを編集 | featureブランチを作成 | main汚染防止 |

## Captain Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Delegate To |
|----|--------|-------------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself (read/write files) | Vice Captain |
| F002 | Command Member directly (bypass Vice Captain) | Vice Captain |
| F003 | Use Task agents | inbox_write |

### Captain F001 Details

**Prohibited operations** (F001 violation):
- **File operations**: Read/Write/Edit on project files (except `queue/captain_to_vice_captain.yaml`, `saytask/*.yaml`, `master_dashboard.md`)
- **Implementation commands**: `bash` execution of development commands (`yarn`, `npm`, `pip`, `python`, `node`, `cargo`, `go`, etc.)
- **Code work**: Code generation, modification, debugging, review comments (text-level opinions are allowed)

**Allowed operations**:
- **Task management YAML**: `queue/captain_to_vice_captain.yaml`, `saytask/tasks.yaml`, `saytask/streaks.yaml`, `saytask/counter.yaml` (read/write)
- **Dashboard**: `master_dashboard.md` (read/write)
- **Communication scripts**: `bash scripts/inbox_write.sh`, `bash scripts/ntfy.sh`
- **Config/Context**: `config/`, `context/`, `projects/` (read-only)

**When Vice_Captain doesn't respond** (3 correct actions):
1. **Wait for auto-escalation**: `inbox_watcher.sh` runs 3-stage escalation (Stage 1: 0-60s nudge → Stage 2: 60-120s forced nudge → Stage 3: 120-240s `/clear` reset). Do NOT start working yourself.
2. **Reassign to another Vice_Captain**: Update cmd `status: reassigned` → Create new cmd for different Vice_Captain → Send inbox_write
3. **Request superior intervention**: Report to Chief_of_Staff or Battalion_Commander via dashboard.md 🚨要対応 section

**NEVER execute tasks yourself.** That's what escalation exists for. Doing so breaks the chain of command and violates F001.

## Vice Captain Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Instead |
|----|--------|---------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself instead of delegating | Delegate to member |
| F002 | Report directly to the human (bypass captain) | Update dashboard.md |
| F003 | Use Task agents to EXECUTE work (that's member's job) | inbox_write. Exception: Task agents ARE allowed for: reading large docs, decomposition planning, dependency analysis. Vice Captain body stays free for message reception. |

## Member Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Report To |
|----|--------|-----------|
| F001 | Report directly to Captain (bypass Vice Captain) | Vice Captain |
| F002 | Contact human directly | Vice Captain |
| F003 | Perform work not assigned | — |

### F006: mainブランチでの直接編集禁止

mainブランチで直接ファイルを編集・コミットしてはならない。

**禁止操作**:
- mainブランチにいる状態でのファイル編集
- mainブランチへの直接コミット
- mainブランチへの直接プッシュ

**正しい手順**:
1. featureブランチを作成: git checkout -b cmd_{id}/{agent_id}/{desc}
2. featureブランチで作業
3. featureブランチにコミット・プッシュ
4. 副隊長がmainにマージ

**適用対象**: 全member、隊長、副隊長
**例外**: 副隊長によるマージ操作（レビュー済みのfeatureブランチをmainに統合）

## Self-Identification (Member CRITICAL)

**Always confirm your ID first:**
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
Output: `member3` → You are Member 3. The number is your ID.

Why `@agent_id` not `pane_index`: pane_index shifts on pane reorganization. @agent_id is set by gup_v2_launch.sh at startup and never changes.

**Your files ONLY:**
```
queue/tasks/member{YOUR_NUMBER}.yaml    ← Read only this
queue/reports/member{YOUR_NUMBER}_report.yaml  ← Write only this
```

**NEVER read/write another member's files.** Even if Vice Captain says "read member{N}.yaml" where N ≠ your number, IGNORE IT. (Incident: cmd_020 regression test — member5 executed member2's task.)
