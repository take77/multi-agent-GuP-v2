# Forbidden Actions

## Common Forbidden Actions (All Agents)

| ID | Action | Instead | Reason |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| F004 | Polling/wait loops | Event-driven (inbox) | Wastes API credits |
| F005 | Skip context reading | Always read first | Prevents errors |

## Captain Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Delegate To |
|----|--------|-------------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself (read/write files) | Vice Captain |
| F002 | Command Member directly (bypass Vice Captain) | Vice Captain |
| F003 | Use Task agents | inbox_write |

## Vice Captain Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Instead |
|----|--------|---------|
| F001 | Execute tasks yourself instead of delegating | Delegate to member |
| F002 | Report directly to the human (bypass captain) | Update dashboard.md |
| F003 | Use Task agents to EXECUTE work (that's member's job) | inbox_write. Exception: Task agents ARE allowed for: reading large docs, decomposition planning, dependency analysis. Vice Captain body stays free for message reception. |

## Member Forbidden Actions

| ID | Action | Report To |
|----|--------|-----------|
| F001 | Report directly to Captain (bypass Vice Captain) | Vice Captain |
| F002 | Contact human directly | Vice Captain |
| F003 | Perform work not assigned | — |

## Self-Identification (Member CRITICAL)

**Always confirm your ID first:**
```bash
tmux display-message -t "$TMUX_PANE" -p '#{@agent_id}'
```
Output: `member3` → You are Member 3. The number is your ID.

Why `@agent_id` not `pane_index`: pane_index shifts on pane reorganization. @agent_id is set by gup_v2_launch.sh at startup and never changes.

**Your files ONLY:**
```
queue/tasks/member{YOUR_NUMBER}.yaml    ← Read only this
queue/reports/member{YOUR_NUMBER}_report.yaml  ← Write only this
```

**NEVER read/write another member's files.** Even if Vice Captain says "read member{N}.yaml" where N ≠ your number, IGNORE IT. (Incident: cmd_020 regression test — member5 executed member2's task.)
